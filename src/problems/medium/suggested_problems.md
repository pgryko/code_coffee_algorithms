## 1. Screening: Basic Operations on a Matrix

**Key Focus:** Manipulating a matrix with some filling/iteration strategy.

- **[54. Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)**  
  *Traverse and fill/collect elements in a spiral manner.*

- **[73. Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)**  
  *Mark rows and columns to be zero based on existing zero elements.*

- **[48. Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)**  
  *Rotate the matrix in-place by 90 degrees.*

While these might not be exactly the problem you faced in the screening, they help practice common matrix transformations and in-place updates.

## 2. Onsite #1: Minimum Path in a Matrix with Obstacles

**Key Focus:** Finding a path in a matrix with obstacles—optimal solution using DP/BFS/DFS.

- **[63. Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)**  
  *Simple DP with obstacles; a good starting point for matrix + DP logic.*

- **[64. Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)**  
  *Classic DP for finding minimum path in a grid without obstacles, can be extended with obstacles.*

- **[1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/)**  
  *BFS-based approach where you can eliminate a limited number of obstacles. A more advanced variant for practicing obstacles + shortest path logic.*

## 3. Onsite #2: Medium-Level Question Based on a Heap

**Key Focus:** Priority Queue usage to efficiently solve a problem—building or transforming data using a min-heap or max-heap.

- **[23. Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)**  
  *Classic usage of a min-heap to merge sorted data.*

- **[215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)**  
  *Demonstrates typical max/min-heap usage or partial sorting approaches.*

- **[347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)**  
  *Use a min-heap or other data structures (hash map + heap) to find the most frequent elements.*

---

## 4. Onsite #3: Modification of Merge Interval (Line Sweep)

**Key Focus:** Interval manipulation and line sweep algorithm.

- **[56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)**  
  *Fundamental interval problem—merging overlapping intervals.*

- **[253. Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)**  
  *Uses line sweep or a min-heap of end times to find the minimum number of rooms.*

- **[759. Employee Free Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/)**  
  *Interval merging across multiple schedules.*

These problems let you practice the line sweep approach in various forms—scheduling, merging intervals, etc.

## 5. “Googlyness” / Behavioral

While not on LeetCode, you’ll also want to practice:
- Behavioral questions focusing on leadership, teamwork, communication, and “Googleyness.”
- Practice STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format to structure answers for scenario-based questions.

---

### Additional Tips:

1. **Matrix DP vs. Backtracking**  
   - Frequently practice converting a backtracking solution into a DP (top-down with memoization or bottom-up) when searching for optimal paths. 
   - Understand time complexity implications.

2. **Heap Usage**  
   - Be comfortable with the standard library’s priority queue (e.g., `priority_queue` in C++ or `heapq` in Python).
   - Practice different use cases (e.g., merging data, finding k-th smallest/largest elements).

3. **Interval Problems**  
   - Focus on sorting intervals correctly and merging/processing them to meet the desired condition.
   - Learn the line sweep method thoroughly (commonly used for meeting rooms, CPU load balancing, flight/railway scheduling, etc.).

By working through these LeetCode problems, you'll gain confidence in the core data structures and algorithms that Google (and other tech giants) commonly test for roles at the Software Engineer II/III level. Good luck with your continued preparation and future interviews!
