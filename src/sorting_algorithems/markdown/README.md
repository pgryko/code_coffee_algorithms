# About Markdown formats

These readmes are designed to be compatible with [gitlab flavoured markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html)

Gitlab flavoured markdown supports math rendering compatible with [katex](https://katex.org/)

For reference, the gitlab markdown and katex documentation are copied here.
