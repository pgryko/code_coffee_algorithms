# Recursion
Recursion is a codeing trick, where a function calls itself.
It's extensively used in transversing trees and graphs - and expect to be asked about it
in interviews.
Computers are linear machines, i.e. under the hood they operate in a linear and computational manner 
(like a recipe, one after the other), hence compilers use a trick called tail call optimisation, to
convert recursive function calls into linear ones.
