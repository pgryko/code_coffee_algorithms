# Bucketsort

Makes assumptions that underlying dataset is a uniform distribution and has an average running time of $`O(n)`$. Whilst counting sort assumes the use of integers, bucket sort assumes input is generated by random process that distributes elements evenly over the the interval $`[0,1)=\{x|0 \leq x < 1 \} `$.

Bucket sort divided the interval [0,1) into n equal sized subintervals or buckets and then distributes the n input numbers into the buckets. The numbers in each buckets are sorted and then the buckets are joined in order.

For an n-element array A where each element A[i], where $` 0 \leq A[i] < 1 `$. An auxillary array B[0,..n-1] of linked lists (buckets) are needed.

```al
Bucket-Sort(A):

let B[0...n-1] be a new array
n = A.length
for i = 0 to n - 1:
    make B[i] and empty list
for i = 1 to n:
    insert A[i] into list B[⌊nA[i⌋]
for i = 0 to n - 1:
    sort list B[i] with insert sort
concatenate lists B[0], B[1], ..., B[n-1] in order
