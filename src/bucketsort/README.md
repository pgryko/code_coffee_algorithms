# Bucketsort

Makes assumptions that underlying dataset is a uniform distribution and has an average running time of $`O(n)`$. Whilst counting sort assumes the use of integers, bucket sort assumes input is generated by random process that distributes elements evenly over the the interval $`[0,1)=\{x|0 \leq x < 1 \} `$.

Bucket sort divided the interval [0,1) into n equal sized subintervals or buckets and then distributes the n input numbers into the buckets. The numbers in each buckets are sorted and then the buckets are joined in order.

For each element A[i], where $` 0 \leq A[i] < 1  `$
